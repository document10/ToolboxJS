#  ToolboxJS
The main purpose of this JS library is to simplify JS as well as bring powerful tools for devs who just want to have
something done quicly.
The code is very documented so with a modern IDE you will understand what each function needs,what it does and what it 
returns.The code itself is not very documented,so understanding it will be a bit tricky.
There are a lot of ways to integrate this library into your project.If you use JS with html use:
<script src="Toolbox.js"></script>
This is fully open-source,so do whatever you want with this.Have fun!
