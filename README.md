# ToolboxJS
#The main purpose of this JS library is to simplify JS as well as bring powerful tools for devs who just want to have
#something tone quicly.
#The code is very documented so with a modern IDE you will understand what each function needs,what it does and what it 
#returns.The ode itself is not very documented,so understanding it will be a bit tricky.
#There are a lot of ways to integrate this library into your project.If you use JS with html use:
<script src="Toolbox.js"></script>
#This is fully open-source,so do whatever you want with this.Have fun!
